# Demolot

Demolot is a simple application intended to turn the process of deciding who is responsible to show a task on 
next Spint Demo into fun. Manage your team members, create a Demo, perform it's draw and let's have fun.

**Note**: don't take it too seriosly. 
Frankly speaking, this project is nothing else but just my personal practicing of Spring Boot 2 together with making fun :smile:
